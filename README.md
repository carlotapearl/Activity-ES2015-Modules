# Activity-ES2015-Modules
The Iron Yard Week 9.4 Pair Programming Activity break up modules using import/export statements

## Instructions  
In this activity, your task is to break up app.js into modules using ES2015 import/export statements. Instructions accompany each function explaining how to do each import/export. You will need to create a file for each function category.
You will implement logic using import and export. All of the function tasks can be found in app.js

## Getting Started  
Download starter files. Open in your text editor and work on breaking up the code into multiple import statements. 

## Your role as a student
Articulate their ideas as best you can. Try to facilitate effective collaboration with your paired student. Be willing to debate strategies for how best to approach your challenge, but donâ€™t allow endless debate to keep you from making progress. Keep your eye on the clock and try to work yourself through the challenge at a reasonable pace. You and your partner should share the responsibility for authoring ideas and code. Finish your challenge and make certain that you call talk someone through the logic and strategies implemented by your group.
